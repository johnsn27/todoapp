## Serverless Challenge

### Before you begin

You will need to have `pnpm` installed. You can install `pnpm` by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Setup

- Run `pnpm install`
- Run `pnpm run install:dynamodb`
- Run `pnpm run dev`

You should now be able to connect to the application via HTTP, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/dev/todos`

### Additional Resources

For more information on setting up `serverless`, follow the instructions here: [Serverless Framework - Getting Started](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started).

### Information for Candidates

- Depending on the position that you are applying for, there are several different lines of questioning that could be taken when reviewing this code during the interview.
- It is recommended that you take some time to get the application up and running in your local environment and review the code to make sure you understand what the application does.
- It is very likely that you will be asked to refactor and/or write some new code during the interview, so please be prepared to get stuck in.
- As you will see, this application is (intentionally) badly written in several ways. The purpose of this is not to trip you up. Rather, we are keen for you to be as opinionated as possible with your analysis of the code.
